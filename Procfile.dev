# Procfile for Foreman

# Main app
web: puma -C config/puma.rb

# Sidekiq job handler
# job: sidekiq -C config/sidekiq.yml.erb

# Watch process with webpack to compile the changed files.
# When making frequent changes to client side assets, you will prefer building webpack assets
# upon saving rather than when you refresh your browser page.
client: sh -c 'rm -rf public/packs/* || true && bin/bundle exec rake react_on_rails:locale && bin/webpack -w'

# Alternative with HMR hot reloading with webpack-dev-server
# You can edit config/webpacker.yml to set HMR to true to see hot reloading.
# Note, hot and live reloading don't work with the default generator setup on top of
# the rails/webpacker Webpack config with server rendering.
# If you have server rendering enabled, modify the call to bin/webpack-dev-server line
# so you add `--inline=false` and then CSS is not inlined.
# Otherwise, you will have an error. If you want HMR and Server Rendering, see
# the example in the https://github.com/shakacode/react-webpack-rails-tutorial
# client: sh -c 'rm -rf public/packs/* || true && bin/bundle exec rake react_on_rails:locale && bin/webpack-dev-server'
